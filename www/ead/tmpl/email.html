    <h3>Send Email</h3>
    <p>
        This form allows you to send a text only version of the archive to
        yourself via email. No graphics or other attachments are included,
        although for long archives this may still involve a lot of text (and
        consequently take a short while to process and send).
    </p>
    <p>
        Please be sure to type in your email address correctly.
